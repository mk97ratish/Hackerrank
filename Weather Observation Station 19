Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.



Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter your query in a single line to avoid error.

select round(sqrt(
    power(max(LAT_N)-min(LAT_N),2)
    +
    power(max(LONG_W)-min(LONG_W),2)
    ),4) from station;
